## 🧠 The Meta

You open DEXScreener.  
Something is up **+300%**.

You click it.

It’s not special:
- Same supply
- Same decimals
- Same structure

What made it run?
- The **name**
- The **ticker**
- The **image**
- The **narrative**

So instead of guessing…

You **fork what already works.**

---

## 🧬 Step 1 — Find a Runner

Go to:
- DEXScreener  
- Birdeye  
- Crypto Twitter  

Find a token that is:
- Pumping  
- Trending  
- Getting attention  

Copy its **mint address**.  
That’s your blueprint.

---

## 🧲 Step 2 — Paste Into the Printer

Open:

👉 [https://jumpbit.io/en/solana/token-manager-tools/create-token-on-solana](https://jumpbit.io/en/solana/token-manager-tools/create-token-on-solana)

Paste the token address.

Jumpbit automatically pulls:
- Supply  
- Decimals  
- Metadata  
- Token structure  

You just cloned a live Solana token.

---

## 🎨 Step 3 — Regenerate With AI (The Secret Sauce)

Click **“Regenerate with AI”**

Jumpbit keeps the **context** of the original token  
but generates:

- A **new name**  
- A **new ticker**  
- A **new logo**  

Same narrative.  
Same meme energy.  
New identity.

You are not making a random coin —  
you are creating a **narrative fork**.

Examples:
```

PEPE  → SpacePepe
DOGE  → TurboDoge
CAT   → LaserCat

```

This is how memes evolve.

---

## 🚀 Step 4 — Deploy

Click **Create**  
Sign once  

You get:
- A new mint  
- Fresh branding  
- Full ownership  
- Fixed supply (if you revoke)  

No code.  
No copying from Solscan.  
No designers.

Just print.

---

## 🔁 Step 5 — Loop

See another runner?

Fork it.  
Remix it.  
Deploy it.  

This is how people spin up:
- Variants  
- Seasonal memes  
- Ecosystem forks  
- Trend hijacks  

Speed wins.

*Memecoins don’t come from ideas.  
They come from iterations.*
